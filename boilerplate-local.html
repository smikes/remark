# Goals

### This talk should make you feel _uncomfortable_.<br>

### This talk is not intended to make anyone feel _unsafe_.<br> (Please follow up with organizers, per CoC.)

---
      
# Definitions

## comfortable
Environment is within tolerable parameters.

--
## safe
Not in danger; free from harm's reach.

---
# Deceptive Similarity

--
## When you feel comfortable...
   No action is necessary

--
## When you feel safe...
   No action is necessary


---
# Critical Distinction 

--
## When you feel **un**-comfortable
   Ignoring it is an option

--
## When you feel **un**-safe...
   Immediate corrective action is necessary (fight/flight/etc.)

---
# Motivating Example

Women should do domestic work and be ornamental -- they are not engineers or project contributors.

# Personal Anecdote

???

in high school I was hanging out with my literary friends.  We used sarcasm. We knew all the tricks, dramatic irony, metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire.

A woman that I didn't know very well said something to me, sort of a backhanded compliment

I responded with (what I intended to be) a sarcastic, self-deprecating reference to a character from a story

... and she ran out of the room crying.

* peer 2 cuts peer 1 out of its trusted network

* peer 3 brokers a resumption between 1&2
* normal 1‚ü∫2 communication resumes

Ultimately a mutual friend was able to vouch for me and I had an opportunity to apologize and eventually we became friends

So at JSFest Jenn threw down this challenge.

I'm not going to talk about impostor syndrome, I don't know enough about it.
(I am a world's expert on Dunning-Kreuger, though.) [laugh line]

It's pretty hard for someone like me to make myself vulnerable.  I am
a straight, white, heterosexual, cis-gendered, well-off, male US
citizen who is not too young and not too old.

But I'll give it a shot.

# Javascript Community's Values

# Personal Anecdote

???

So I decided I wanted to join this community, the javascript
community.  I decided to attend a weeklong conference, JSFest 2014.

And then #gamergate happened.  And I discovered that I couldn't follow
or RT some people on twitter.  I found out that I was on a blocklist.

At first I thought this was some mistake, because although I could
find the date that I was added to this list, I couldn't find a tweet
in my timeline that made sense to have caused that.

But um, "luckily" for me the people who run that blocklist keep
records of these things and they were able to point out exactly what I
had said.

And this is where I would like to say, I recognized that I had done
something unkind.

But actually my first reaction was about how unfair it was, and how
could these people who didn't even know me be so mean to me and not
even take a joke, and all kinds of other embarrassing tantrum-y
things.

But I was lucky because I had decided that I would wait a full day
between each response I made to this thread.

---
# Personal Anecdote

<img align="center" src="Peers.png">
???

And I realized that they had done a very reasonable thing.  They had
identified me as possibly hostile, not tried to engage with me and
change my mind (which probably wouldn't have worked at the time), and
just marked me as a threat.

And I was able to introspect and see that I had been rude, mean,
unkind.  And I felt embarrassed.  And I felt ashamed.  And so I
apologized.

And about a week later I was taken off the blocklist.

---
# Personal Anecdote

<img align="center" src="Peers-3.png">
???

And now I can RT again, and fully interact with the community, and
that's because some strangers were really, really kind to me.  They
identified something I had said that was hurtful; they didn't confront
me, but gently informed me about it (by putting me on a block list);
and they gave me a second chance.  It was a priceless service, and
they did it all for free.

So as I said above I feel ashamed about this, but if you have
curiosity about it you can find it pretty easily or you can just talk
to me later, 1-to-1 or online.

# Making Mistakes

## In speaking out, you will make mistakes

## But saying nothing is a different kind of mistake

--

## You may have to make yourself un-**comfortable**

## in order to help someone feel **safe**

???
Sometimes people feel like they can't or shouldn't contribute or respond because they might say the wrong thing.  That's a good worry, and it probably will happen that you say the wrong thing.

But consider that saying nothing is probably also a wrong thing.
