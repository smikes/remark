# Goals

### This talk should make you feel _uncomfortable_.<br>

### This talk is not intended to make anyone feel _unsafe_.<br> (Please follow up with organizers, per CoC.)

---
      
# Definitions

## comfortable
Environment is within tolerable parameters.

--
## safe
Not in danger; free from harm's reach.

---
# Deceptive Similarity

--
## When you feel comfortable...
   No action is necessary

--
## When you feel safe...
   No action is necessary


---
# Critical Distinction 

--
## When you feel **un**-comfortable
   Corrective action is possible <br>
   Ignoring discomfort is an option

--
## When you feel **un**-safe...
   Immediate corrective action is necessary <br>
   Fight/flight response; very **draining**

---
# Motivating Example

## Pouring sewage into a person's tank faster than they can pump it out.

# Examples of Microaggressions

# Personal Anecdote

???

in high school I was hanging out with my literary friends.  We used sarcasm. We knew all the tricks, dramatic irony, metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and satire.

A woman that I didn't know very well said something to me, sort of a backhanded compliment

I responded with (what I intended to be) a sarcastic, self-deprecating reference to a character from a story

... and she ran out of the room crying.

---
# I know **I** don't do things like that
--

## Because nobody ever calls me on them
--

## Possible causes:
--

#### I'm not dumping any sewage?
> my buggy brain wants me to believe this <br>
> (Fundamental Attribution Error)<br>
> it's probably not true

--

#### People are trying to call me on it, but I'm ignoring them.

--
#### People are choosing not to call me on it because they don't want <br>to deal with me.

--

> can I rule these out?

So at JSFest Jenn threw down this challenge.

I'm not going to talk about impostor syndrome, I don't know enough about it.
(I am a world's expert on Dunning-Kreuger, though.) [laugh line]

It's pretty hard for someone like me to make myself vulnerable.  I am
a straight, white, heterosexual, cis-gendered, well-off, male US
citizen who is not too young and not too old.

But I'll give it a shot.

Sometimes people feel like they can't or shouldn't contribute or respond because they might say the wrong thing.  That's a good worry, and it probably will happen that you say the wrong thing.

But consider that saying nothing is probably also a wrong thing.

# Responding to microaggressions

### -They're all too busy working out and looking pretty

### I responded
> Maybe you need a fatherly person instead.  My kids say I make pretty good pancakes, how about if I come around tomorrow morning?

---
# Responding to microaggressions

### You should get a tattoo or something to prove you're nerdy enough to be here.

### I responded
> She doesn't need to do or have anything to prove she belongs here.  Being here is proof enough.
