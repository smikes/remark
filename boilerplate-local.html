in high school I was hanging out with my friends; we were really into
sarcasm.

A woman I didn't know very well said something to me, and I
interpreted as a backhanded compliment.  So I responded in kind, with
a self-deprecating sarcastic comment.

... and she ran out of the room crying.

Because I had caused her tank to overflow.  But my intent was good, right?
So should I run after her and explain myself?

No, of course not.  I knew that even at the age of 17.

So at JSFest Jenn threw down this challenge.

I'm not going to talk about impostor syndrome, I don't know enough about it.
(I am a world's expert on Dunning-Kreuger, though.) [laugh line]

It's pretty hard for someone like me to make myself vulnerable.  I am
a straight, white, heterosexual, cis-gendered, well-off, male US
citizen who is not too young and not too old.

But I'll give it a shot.

Sometimes people feel like they can't or shouldn't contribute or respond because they might say the wrong thing.  That's a good worry, and it probably will happen that you say the wrong thing.

But consider that saying nothing is probably also a wrong thing.

## Maybe you need a fatherly person instead.  My kids say I make pretty good pancakes, how about if I come around tomorrow morning?
