# Personal Anecdote

???

in high school I was hanging out with my literary friends and I had just read an ironic story about Feminism and dating in Harper's magazine

There was an anecdote in this story about how the heroine had to comfort a man about his inability to experience menstruation, and how that prevented him from being a true feminist

[by the way the reason this is funny-not-funny is that often a problem behavior of an "aly" is to make the conversation about themselves]

Anyway a woman that I didn't know very well said something to me, sort of a backhanded compliment and I responded with (what I intended to be) a sarcastic, self-deprecating reference to this character in the story

... and she ran out of the room crying.

Ultimately a mutual friend was able to vouch for me and I had an opportunity to apologize and eventually we became friends

# Personal anecdote

???
So I decided I wanted to join this community, the javascript community.  I decided to attend this weeklong conference.

And then #gamergate happened.  (And as an aside, I have an 11-year-old daughter who loves video games, especially Minecraft Pokemon, and I would like to live in a world where she could post a video online about that and be reasonably confident not to receive death or rape threats.)

And I discovered that I couldn't follow or RT some people on twitter.  I found out that I was on a blocklist.

At first I thought this was some mistake, because although I could find the date that I was added to this list, I couldn't find a tweet in my timeline that made sense to have caused that.

But um, "luckily" for me they keep records of these things and they were able to point out exactly what I had said.

And this is where I would like to say, I recognized that I had done something unkind.

But actually my first reaction was about how unfair it was, and how could these people who didn't even know me be so mean to me and not even take a joke, and all kinds of other embarrassing tantrum-y things.

But I was lucky because I had decided that I would wait a full day between responses to this thread.

And I realized that they had done a very reasonable thing.  They had identified me as probably hostile, not tried to engage with me and change my mind (which probably wouldn't have worked at the time), and just marked me as a threat.

And I was able to introspect and see that I had been rude, mean, unkind.  And I felt embarrassed.  And I felt ashamed.  And so I apologized.

And about a week later I was taken off the blocklist.

And now I can RT people again, and fully interact with the community, and that's because some strangers were really, really kind to me.  They identified something I had said that was hurtful; they didn't confront me, but gently informed me about it (by putting me on a block list); and they gave me a second chance.  It was a priceless service, and they did it all for free.

So as I said above I feel ashamed about this, but if you have curiosity about it you can find it pretty easily or you can just talk to me later, 1-to-1 or online.

# How to be a 10x Developer

# Responding to microaggressions

### I responded
> She doesn't need to do or haave anything to prove she belongs here.  Being here is proof enough.

# Responding to microaggressions

# Making Mistakes

### In speaking out, you will make mistakes

### But saying nothing can also be a mistake

???
Sometimes people feel like they can't or shouldn't contribute or respond because they might say the wrong thing.  That's a good worry, and it probably will happen that you say the wrong thing.

But conisder that saying nothing is probably also a wrong thing.
